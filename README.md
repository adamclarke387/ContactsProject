# Programming Portfolio - Assignment 2

This program was built to function as a Contacts application and has the ability to add and delete a contact as well as editing an already existing contact. Furthermore, users will be able to search for a specific contact based on their values, or be able to bring up a list of all contacts stored in the application.

The 'contacts_class.py' file holds the code to add and save (append) a new Contact to the csv file and the 'contacts_manager.py' holds the code to delete, edit, search for a single contact, or search for all contacts.
- To run the program as a whole run 'main.py'
- To test the program run 'program_test.py'
